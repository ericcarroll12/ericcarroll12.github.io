                    Hi, my name is Eric. I’m a programmer with a passion for tackling complex problems and creating simple solutions.
                    At the age of 13 I was fortunate enough to save up enough money to build my own
                    pc with second-hand parts to play Starcraft. I didn’t know anything about building computers but after slogging 
                    through a few manuals (a herculean task for a thirteen-year old’s attention span) and watching a few YouTube videos, 
                    I felt confident enough to give it a try. Putting all those crap computer parts together, pressing the power 
                    button and watching my first computer breath life is a high I have been chasing my entire professional life. 
                    Fast-forward a decade, I was working on my B.S in computer science and I met the head of U.S. operations for 
                    Spares in Motion. I took them on as a client to build a mobile app, and the relationship I built there has kept 
                    me at Spares in Motion to this day.
                </p>

                    I am currently leading a team of developers and mathematicians in all U.S. based technical 
                    projects at Spares in Motion. Spares in Motion is a growing international company that specializes 
                    in the sale and refurbishment of spare parts for the wind and solar energy sector. Some of these 
                    projects include a mobile application to track pictures taken of part refurbishments, an 
                    internal web portal to manage refurbishment work orders, and a CO2 calculator to determine the 
                    amount of CO2 saved on part refurbishment versus a new part order.

                    I live in the beautiful mountains of Colorado with my wife and our two cats. When I 
                    am not building stuff and writing code, I'm probably jamming with my saxophone or painting
                    Warhammer figures. But odds are these days I'm stuck on some boss in Elden Ring.
